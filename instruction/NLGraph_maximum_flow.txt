Question: In a directed graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are:
an edge from node 1 to node 3 with capacity 4,
an edge from node 1 to node 0 with capacity 9,
an edge from node 2 to node 1 with capacity 4,
an edge from node 3 to node 1 with capacity 4,
an edge from node 4 to node 3 with capacity 1,
an edge from node 4 to node 5 with capacity 2,
an edge from node 5 to node 1 with capacity 4,
an edge from node 5 to node 0 with capacity 7.
Q: What is the maximum flow from node 4 to node 0?


Analysis:
(1) To find the maximum flow from node 4 to node 0, we use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, which leverages the concept of augmenting paths in the residual graph.

(2) Represent the graph with capacities as an adjacency matrix or list:
0: []
1: [(3, 4), (0, 9)]
2: [(1, 4)]
3: [(1, 4)]
4: [(3, 1), (5, 2)]
5: [(1, 4), (0, 7)]

(3) Initialize the flow for each edge to 0 and set up a residual capacity matrix equal to the given capacities.

(4) Use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find augmenting paths from source (4) to sink (0):
Start from node 4, find path 4 → 5 → 0 with a minimum capacity of 2 (edge 4-5 has capacity 2).
Update residual capacities: 4-5 becomes 0, 5-0 becomes 5.
Increment flow by 2.

(5) Repeat BFS to find another augmenting path:
Path found: 4 → 3 → 1 → 0 with minimum capacity 1 (edge 4-3 has capacity 1).
Update residual capacities: 4-3 becomes 0, 3-1 becomes 3, 1-0 becomes 8.
Increment flow by 1.

(6) No more augmenting paths are found by BFS, as there's no path with positive residual capacity from 4 to 0.

(7) Sum of all flows from source to sink gives the maximum flow.

Final Answer: The maximum flow from node 4 to node 0 is 3.
