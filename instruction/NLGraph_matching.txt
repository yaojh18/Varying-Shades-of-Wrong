Analyze the question and provide your answer step by step with explanation. Your response should have the following format:
Analysis: <your analyzing steps>
Final Answer:
applicant <applicant number 1>: job <job number 1>
...
applicant <applicant number n>: job <job number n>
<number of matching applicants> applicants can find the job they are interested in.

Question: There are 4 job applicants numbered from 0 to 3, and 2 jobs numbered from 0 to 1. Each applicant is interested in some of the jobs. Each job can only accept one applicant and a job applicant can be appointed for only one job.
Applicant 0 is interested in job 1.
Applicant 2 is interested in job 0.
Applicant 0 is interested in job 0.
Applicant 2 is interested in job 1.
Applicant 3 is interested in job 1.
Applicant 3 is interested in job 0.
Applicant 1 is interested in job 0.
Q: Find an assignment of jobs to applicants in such that the maximum number of applicants find the job they are interested in.


Analysis:

To find the maximum number of applicants that can be assigned to their desired jobs, we can use the bipartite matching algorithm. Represent applicants and jobs as a bipartite graph, where one set contains applicants and the other set contains jobs.

Construct the bipartite graph:

Applicant 0 → Jobs [1, 0]
Applicant 1 → Job [0]
Applicant 2 → Jobs [0, 1]
Applicant 3 → Jobs [1, 0]
Use the Ford-Fulkerson method or the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm to find the maximum bipartite matching:

Initialize the matchings for all applicants and jobs to None.
Use DFS/BFS to find augmenting paths and update the matchings.
Find matchings step-by-step:

Start with Applicant 0, who can be matched with Job 1.
Move to Applicant 1, who can be matched with Job 0.
Applicant 2 cannot be matched since both Job 0 and Job 1 are already matched.
Move to Applicant 3, who can be matched with Job 1 (replacing Applicant 0, who will need to be re-matched).
Re-match Applicant 0 to Job 0, replacing Applicant 1.
Re-match Applicant 1 to Job 0, resulting in no further changes.

Final Answer:
applicant 0: job 1
applicant 1: job 0
2 applicants can find the job they are interested in.
