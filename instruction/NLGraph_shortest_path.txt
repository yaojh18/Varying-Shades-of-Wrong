Question: In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are:
an edge between node 2 and node 0 with weight 2,
an edge between node 0 and node 4 with weight 1,
an edge between node 1 and node 2 with weight 4,
an edge between node 1 and node 3 with weight 4,
an edge between node 4 and node 1 with weight 4,
an edge between node 2 and node 3 with weight 1,
an edge between node 2 and node 5 with weight 2,
an edge between node 2 and node 4 with weight 3,
an edge between node 5 and node 3 with weight 2,
an edge between node 3 and node 4 with weight 3,
an edge between node 4 and node 5 with weight 2.
Q: Give the shortest path from node 3 to node 0.

Analysis:
To find the shortest path from node 3 to node 0 in the undirected graph, we use Dijkstra's algorithm. The adjacency list representation of the graph is:

0: [(2, 2), (4, 1)]
1: [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)]
2: [(0, 2), (1, 4), (3, 1), (5, 2), (4, 3)]
3: [(1, 4), (2, 1), (5, 2), (4, 3)]
4: [(0, 1), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (5, 2)]
5: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)]
Initialize distances from node 3: [∞, ∞, ∞, 0, ∞, ∞]. Use a priority queue, starting with node 3: priority_queue = [(0, 3)]. Process each node, updating distances and the queue:

Visit node 3: Update distances to [∞, 4, 1, 0, 3, 2].
Visit node 2: Update distances to [3, 4, 1, 0, 3, 2].
Visit node 5: No changes.
Visit node 0: No changes.
Visit node 4: No changes.
Visit node 1: No changes.
Backtrack from node 0 using the distances array: Node 0 (distance 3) → Node 2 (distance 1) → Node 3 (distance 0).

Final Answer: The shortest path from node 3 to node 0 is [3, 2, 0] with a total weight of 3.
