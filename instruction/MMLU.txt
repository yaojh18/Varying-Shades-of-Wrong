Question: Classical economists generally believe that I.   wages fluctuate quickly II.   Say's law does not hold III.   input and output prices will stay in line with each other IV.   the government should not worry about maintaining aggregate demand at an adequate level
Options:
A. II, III and IV only
B. II and III only
C. I and II only
D. I and IV only
E. I and III only
F. I III and IV only
G. II and IV only
H. I, II and III only
I. III and IV only

Analysis:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement in relation to classical economic thought:
I. Wages fluctuate quickly: Classical economists generally believe in flexible wages and prices, which adjust to ensure markets clear.
II. Say's law does not hold: Classical economists believe in Say's Law, which states that supply creates its own demand. Therefore, this statement is incorrect for classical economists.
III. Input and output prices will stay in line with each other: Classical economists believe that prices, including input and output prices, are flexible and will adjust to reflect changes in supply and demand, maintaining equilibrium.
IV. The government should not worry about maintaining aggregate demand at an adequate level: Classical economists believe that markets are self-regulating and that government intervention to maintain aggregate demand is unnecessary.
Based on this analysis:
- I is correct (classical economists believe wages fluctuate quickly).
- II is incorrect (classical economists believe Say's Law holds).
- III is correct (classical economists believe input and output prices stay in line with each other).
- IV is correct (classical economists believe government should not worry about aggregate demand).
So, the correct statements are I, III, and IV.

Final Answer: F
